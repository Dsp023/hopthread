# HOPTHREAD UPGRADES - 2026-02-22

The Loom has been tightened. Today's upgrades focus on **Tactile Intelligence** and **Visual Synthesis**.

## 🧠 Neural Console (UI)
- **Node-Click Analysis:** You can now click any node in the Neural Map to trigger a deep analysis of that specific file. The system automatically weaves a "Analyze the file [path]" thread.
- **Use Case Modal:** Added a dedicated "Use Cases" view. It fetches `USE_CASES.md`, renders it as high-fidelity Markdown, and displays it in a sleek, glass-morphism modal.
- **Live Markdown Rendering:** Integrated `marked.js` for real-time rendering of documentation within the console.

## ⌨️ Neural TUI (Terminal)
- **Grid-Based Layout:** Implemented using `blessed-contrib` for a high-density command center.
- **Thread Stream:** A real-time scrolling log of user inputs and AI pulse responses.
- **Codebase Tree:** A visual directory explorer integrated into the terminal.
- **Async Weaving:** Direct access to the `getPulse` core from the terminal.

## 🧬 Intelligence Grafts (AI Logic)
- **Automated Scanning:** Integrated logic into `TheEye` to identify "High Value" AI injection points (long functions, complex async, TODOs).
- **Graft Glower:** Neural Map nodes now glow gold if the scanner identifies them as graft candidates.
- **Contextual Weaving:** Clicking a gold node in the UI triggers a specialized "Identify intelligence grafts" thread rather than a general analysis.

## ⚡ Ghost Commits (Safety)
- **Dry-Run Engine:** Integrated a simulation mode into `TheHand`.
- **Pre-flight Logs:** Added `[GHOST]` log prefixes to identify simulated system changes.
- **Diff Preview:** Basic support for proposed file changes without touching the disk.

## 👁️ The Eye (Tools)
- **Enhanced Dependency Detection:** Rewrote the regex engine to capture a wider range of import patterns (ESM, CommonJS, and relative paths).
- **Path Metadata:** Nodes in the visual map now carry full relative path metadata, enabling the "click-to-analyze" feature.

## 🛠️ CLI & Stability
- **Stable UI Launch:** Fixed template literal escaping issues that were causing Bun runtime errors during the `ui` command launch.
- **Auto-Config:** Updated logic to handle `.env` injection more gracefully.
