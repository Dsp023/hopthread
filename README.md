# Hopthread 🧶

**Hopthread** is a high-fidelity, agentic AI framework built for the next generation of digital ecosystems. It is designed to be the "thread" that connects intelligent thought (LLMs) to technical execution (System/OS).

Built with **Bun** for ultra-fast performance and multi-model support for high-velocity intelligence.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Hopthread is structured into four core modules:

1.  **The Loom (CLI):** The command-line interface where threads are spun.
2.  **The Pulse (AI Brain):** The core agentic loop with native function-calling and multi-provider support.
3.  **The Eye (Analysis Tools):** The sensory layer that scans, maps, and analyzes codebase architecture.
4.  **The Hand (System Tools):** The execution layer that allows the agent to run shell commands and manipulate the filesystem.

## 📺 Tactical Command Centers

Hopthread provides dual-layered operational control:

- **Neural Console (Web):** A high-fidelity, interactive dashboard.
    - **Live Neural Map:** Real-time Force-Graph dependency mapping.
    - **Intelligence Glow:** Visual indicators (gold nodes) for AI enhancement potential.
    - **Tactile Analysis:** Click nodes to trigger deep contextual file audits.
    - **Use Case Modal:** Instant Markdown-rendered project discovery.
- **Neural TUI (Terminal):** A high-density command center for terminal-exclusive workflows.
    - **Thread Stream:** Real-time scrolling log of agent thought sequences.
    - **Codebase Tree:** Live directory exploration inside the terminal.

## 🧠 Multi-Model Intelligence

Hopthread supports the world's most powerful inference engines. Switch brains on the fly:

- **Groq:** Llama-3.3-70B for low-latency synthesis.
- **NVIDIA NIM:** Kimi-K2.5 for deep architectural reasoning.
- **Google Gemini:** Gemini-2.0-Flash for multimodal capabilities.
- **OpenAI:** GPT-4o integration.

## 🧶 Core Weaves (Features)

1.  **Codebase Synthesis:** Instant high-fidelity architectural summaries.
2.  **TADOW (✨ Vibe Coding):** High-velocity, aesthetic-first manifestation engine.
3.  **Intelligence Grafts:** Automated identification of "High-Value" AI injection points.
4.  **Ghost Commits:** Simulated execution and diff previews before system mutation.
5.  **The Architect's Redline:** Automatic detection of friction, redundancy, and logic bugs.
6.  **Visual Mapping:** Live-updating Force-Graph and Mermaid.js diagrams.
7.  **Context Condenser:** Token-optimized snapshots for external LLM analysis.
