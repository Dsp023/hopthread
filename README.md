#  Hopthread 🧶 

**Hopthread** is a high-fidelity, agentic AI framework built for the next generation of digital ecosystems. It is designed to be the "thread" that connects intelligent thought (LLMs) to technical execution (System/OS).

Built with **Bun** for ultra-fast performance and multi-model support for high-velocity intelligence.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

Hopthread is structured into three core modules:

1.  **The Loom (CLI):** The command-line interface where threads are spun.
2.  **The Pulse (AI Brain):** The core agentic loop with native function-calling and multi-provider support.
3.  **The Hand (System Tools):** The execution layer that allows the agent to run shell commands and manipulate the filesystem.

## 🧠 Multi-Model Intelligence

Hopthread now supports the world's most powerful inference engines. You can switch your agent's brain on the fly:

- **Groq:** Llama-3.3-70B for low-latency synthesis.
- **NVIDIA NIM:** Kimi-K2.5 for deep architectural reasoning.
- **Google Gemini:** Gemini-2.0-Flash for multimodal capabilities.
- **OpenAI:** GPT-4o integration.

## 🧶 The Four Weaves (Killer Features)

Hopthread doesn't just read code; it weaves it into actionable intelligence:

1.  **Codebase Synthesis (BRIEFING.md):** Instant high-fidelity architectural summaries of any folder.
2.  **The Architect's Redline:** Automatic detection of friction, redundant logic, and potential bugs.
3.  **Visual Mapping (DIAGRAM.md):** Auto-generated Mermaid.js diagrams of module relationships.
4.  **Context Condenser (.ht-context):** A token-optimized snapshot for pasting into other LLMs (Claude/ChatGPT).
5.  **Intelligence Graft:** Targeted suggestions for where and how to integrate AI into your specific app.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime installed.
- One or more API keys (Groq, NVIDIA, Google, or OpenAI).

### Installation

1.  **Clone and Setup:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dsp023/hopthread.git
    cd hopthread
    bun install
    bun link
    ```

2.  **Configure from Terminal:**
    ```bash
    hopthread config groq_key <your_key>
    hopthread config nvidia_key <your_key>
    hopthread config provider nvidia  # Set active brain to Kimi K2.5
    ```

---

##  Usage

### Check System Pulse
```bash
hopthread pulse
```

### Weave a Full Synthesis
```bash
hopthread weave "Synthesize the codebase at ./src"
```

### Launch the Tactile Console
```bash
hopthread ui
```
